## Syllabus
The course covers basic concepts, models, and algorithms in linear optimization, integer optimization, and convex optimization. The first module of the course is a general overview of key concepts in optimization and associated mathematical background. The second module of the course is on linear optimization, covering modeling techniques, basic polyhedral theory, simplex method, and duality theory. The third module is on nonlinear optimization and convex conic optimization, which is a significant generalization of linear optimization. The fourth and final module is on integer optimization, which augments the previously covered optimization models with the flexibility of integer decision variables. The course blends optimization theory and computation with various applications to modern data analytics.
